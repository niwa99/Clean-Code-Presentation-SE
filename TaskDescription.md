# Hands-On Task: LotterySimulation #
## 1. Introduction ##
In order to internalize the recently discussed Clean-Code-rules, the following task will focus on refactoring a given code.
There are two files which relate to this task:
- [LotterySimulation - Code to be refactored](https://github.com/niwa99/Clean-Code-Presentation-SE/blob/master/LotterySimulation.java)
- [LotterySimulationClean - Solution](https://github.com/niwa99/Clean-Code-Presentation-SE/blob/master/LotterySimulationClean.java)

## 2. Task ##
A lottery program has been developed which fulfills the following functions:
Starting the program, six lottery numbers from 1 to 49 and a bonus number are generated and sorted (compare: "6 aus 49" and "Superzahl").
After that, the generated numbers are printed to the console and the user is asked if another "generating-round" should be started.

The given code ([LotterySimulation](https://github.com/niwa99/Clean-Code-Presentation-SE/blob/master/LotterySimulation.java)) contains a lot of bad code which has to be refactored.
Be aware of the four important clean-code-characteristics (Meaningful Names, Methods, Comments and Formatting), which you heard in the presentation. If you want, you can read the tutorial for refactoring code parallely.

## 3. Afterwork ##
When you refactored the given code, you can have a look into the solution: [LotterySimulationClean - Solution](https://github.com/niwa99/Clean-Code-Presentation-SE/blob/master/LotterySimulationClean.java).
Please be aware of the fact that this solution is definitely NOT the perfect solution - probably, there won't be any "perfect" solution.
